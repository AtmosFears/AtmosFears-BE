To be able to use the prediction model in this project you need to have R environment set up.

First, you need to download and install the R itself.
You can do that via this link: https://cloud.r-project.org/

Then you need to download and install couple additional packages:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Cubist/index.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rules/index.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/index.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zip/
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openxlsx/

Depending on the platform you use you need to do it slightly differently,
but it pretty much comes down to placing the downloaded decompressed file into the library director of R.
For the server, there will a script auto installing this lovely mess (not implemented yet).
